# al-folio
A simple and clean [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.

The original theme was published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and copyrighted under the MIT license.

### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first fork the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve # Add "--incremental" for faster incremental builds.
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, you can deploy it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script:

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy
```

### Ergonomic Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.

### Collections
This Jekyll theme implements collections to let you break up your work into categories.
The example is divided into news, poetry, and projects, but easily revamp this into apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is.
> To do this, edit the collections in the config file, create a corresponding folder, and update the portfolio and poetry source files.

Three different layouts are includedâ€”the poetry layout, for a simple list of entries, the blog layout (`blog/index.html`), for more detailed descriptive list of entries, and the portfolio layout.
The projects layout overlays a descriptive hoverover on a background image.
If no image is provided, the square is auto-filled with the chosen theme color.
Thumbnail sizing is not necessary, as the grid crops images perfectly.

### Theming
Six beautiful theme colors have been selected to choose from.
The default is purple, but quickly change it by editing the `_sass/base.scss` file in line 40.
The color variable are listed there, as well.

### Photos
Photo formatting is made simple using rows of a 3-column system.
Make photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.
Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and projects pages.

### Code Highlighting
This theme implements Jekyll's built in code syntax highlighting with Pygments.
Just use a liquid tag to delineate your code:
{% highlight python %} code code code {% endhighlight %}
